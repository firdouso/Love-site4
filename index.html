    <p>I made this just for you. You are my angel, my safe place, my forever. ❤️</p>

      <p>
        From the moment we met, my world became brighter. Your smile, your kindness, your love — 
        it's everything to me. I feel lucky every single day to call you mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope this little site brings a smile to your face the way you always bring one to mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you endlessly. ✨
